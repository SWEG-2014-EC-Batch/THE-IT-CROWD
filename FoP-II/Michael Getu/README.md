# Repository README

Welcome to my repository!

## Introduction

This repository serves as a platform for showcasing my class activities, homework, and assignments. Here, you will find a collection of my work completed during the course, allowing you to explore and gain insight into the topics covered.

## Contents

The repository is organized into three main sections:

### 1. Class Activities

The "Class Activities" folder contains the activities completed during class sessions. These activities are designed to reinforce the concepts taught in lectures and provide hands-on practice. Each activity is organized in a separate subfolder, named according to the activity or topic. Feel free to browse through the subfolders to delve into the various activities and explore the solutions.

### 2. Homework

The "Homework" folder contains the assignments given by the instructor to further enhance learning. These assignments are carefully crafted to challenge our understanding and problem-solving skills. Each assignment is organized in a separate subfolder, labeled with the corresponding assignment numbers or topics. Feel free to explore the subfolders to access the assignment instructions and my solutions.

### 3. Assignments

The "Assignments" folder comprises larger assignments or projects assigned throughout the course. These assignments require a deeper understanding of the topics covered and often involve multiple components. Each assignment has its own subfolder, which contains all the necessary files and resources related to that particular assignment. Feel free to explore the subfolders to discover the assignments I have worked on and the solutions I have developed.
