## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to IT-CROWD's README file!IT-CROUD is a merged group of Shadow coders and it crowd.We are a group of open-minded  individuals who are driven by a common purpose. Our group is focused on solving problems, and we are motivated  to achieve our goals.we believe that we have  different level of knowledge and skill in the technology  so as a group we always help each other to strive common goals.
Our group is focused on Technology. We believe that in time management, and we are committed to working towards that goal through various initiatives and projects. Our aim is to go through the final in different perspectives , and we are always looking for new ways to make a positive impact in our focus area.
